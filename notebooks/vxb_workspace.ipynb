It is interesting to notice that both targets (DRD2 and HTR1A) could be successfully predicted by GraphEvo (Table S6). Explainability of ESKG in gene druggability prediction . The above results demonstrated the satisfying performance of the ESKG-derived model (GraphEvo) in the task of gene druggability prediction . We speculated that an important reason for these results is that highly druggable targets may have some evolutionary hallmarks, which could be extracted from the ESKG . It was found that 78.95% of highly druggable targets are Ohnologs (Fig . 3C and Table S5), which are generated by two WGD events in the early vertebrate lineage and are strongly associated with diseases because of their dosage sensitivity . The Ohnolog ratio of highly druggable targets was significantly higher than that of nonhighly druggable targets (P = 7.40 x 10-8, chi2 test) (Fig . 3C). In addition to the evolutionary hallmark of Ohnologs, our analysis revealed that highly druggable targets were enriched in genes that originated in the Eumetazoa stage (P = 1.86 x 10-7, hypergeometric distribution test) (Fig . 3D and Table S5). We reasoned that this may be because the approved activities of a high percentage of highly druggable targets belong to the psychiatry and psychology category (Fig . 3E), and the nervous system of organisms first appeared in the Eumetazoa stage according to evolutionary common sense . Taken together, our results indicate that compared with targets with fewer successful drugs, highly druggable targets have more distinctive evolutionary hallmarks that have been integrated by the ESKG.'}},\n",

The results showed that for 468 successful targets, the approved drug activities of 77.78% (364) of the targets are consistent with ESKG-derived disease categories, reflecting the potential of ESKG in the activity prediction of drug targets (Table S4). Prediction of gene druggability by ESKG . Application of ESKG in gene druggability prediction . GraphEvo could also predict the druggability of genes and further identify highly druggable targets by fusing the features derived from the ESKG and the target-disease graph (TDG) (Fig . 2). Based on King et al .'s and Quan et al .'s data, we obtained 1,536 approved target-disease pairs, covering 468 successful targets, and 114 of 468 (24.36%) had a number of approved drugs greater than or equal to 10, which were defined as highly druggable targets in our paper (Fig . 3A and B and Table S5). First, we used the KG embedding model TransE to extract the embeddings of the ESKG as features of drug targets . In addition, it is obvious that target-disease associations could provide abundant information about the druggability of drug targets . Therefore, using a graph convolutional network (GCN) with the layer attention, we also obtained graph-derived features of drug targets from the TDG . Finally, we concatenated the ESKG-derived features and TDG-derived features of drug targets and utilized the machine learning model of support vector regression and decision tree regression to construct an identification model for highly druggable targets (Fig . 2). In detail, our research divided 468 successful targets into training and test sets according to their approval times; that is, drug targets approved before the year 2000 were the training set, and drug targets approved after the year 2000 were the test set . We mainly used two common machine learning evaluation indicators, the AUC and top-K recall, to evaluate the effectiveness of this model . GraphEvo achieved an AUC of 0.95, and the top-30 recall was 100% in the test set, which means that our model could recall all 9 highly druggable targets in the top 30 predictions (see Materials and methods). Moreover, we found that our model could identify highly druggable targets that are likely to be excluded by previous studies . Recently, a risk gene predictive model called integrative RIsk Gene Selector (iRIGS) has been established by integrating multiomic data and gene networks, and ~100 high-confidence risk genes of schizophrenia were predicted based on iRIGS and considered as potential targets.\"}},\n",

Prediction of gene targetability by ESKG . To verify the effectiveness of the ESKG in the targetability prediction for human genes, we first applied the ESKG-derived information of genes to construct the targetability prediction model named GraphEvo . In this study, we used ESKG-derived embeddings (learned from TransE) as input features of genes and adopted the ensemble learning algorithm boosting to develop the targetability prediction model (Fig . 2). In the modeling process, we took the target-disease pairs that were marketed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the year 2000 as positive samples and randomly generated a considerable number of gene-disease pairs without clinical trial records as negative samples . As a result, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of our targetability prediction model reached 0.82 (F1 score = 0.82). Moreover, we found that the accuracy of gene targetability predicted by GraphEvo increased significantly across the target development pipeline (Table S3). For targets in the preclinical stage, only 24.59% were identified by GraphEvo . For targets in clinical stages, these ratios were 27.14% (phase I), 34.73% (phase II), and 46.95% (phase III). In the approved stage, up to 68.59% of currently successful targets were identified by GraphEvo, indicating that GraphEvo can effectively predict the targetability potential of in-research targets . In addition, based on the sequence, structural, physicochemical, and human system profile information of the targets, Zhu et al . used an in silico method to evaluate the approval potential of 31 targets in phase III clinical trials in 2009, of which 16 targets were predicted to be promising candidates . By 2018, 10 of these 16 (62.5%) promising targets were approved by the FDA . In comparison, we used our targetability prediction model (GraphEvo) to analyze the approval potential of these 31 targets . The results of our model showed that seven targets had approval potential, and they all (100%) became approved targets by 2018 . The above study demonstrated the application value of ESKG and GraphEvo in targetability prediction . In addition to predicting the targetability of genes, we also calculated the associated scores between drug targets and diseases using ESKG . Similar to predictions of disease causative genes, we used the TransE model to calculate the associated potential of each successful target-involved triplet (i.e . the successful drug target, disease, and corresponding relation) in the ESKG and used it as the associated score between a drug target and a certain disease category.'}},\n",

       "   'text': \"As a result, compared with the initial KG which does not contain evolutionary knowledge, the ESKG was more effective in causative gene prediction in 17 kinds of these diseases (i.e . alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease [AD], asthma, ataxia telangiectasia, colitis, colorectal neoplasms, dementia vascular, depressive disorder, diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy, gonorrhea, Huntington disease, influenza, intellectual disability, leukemia lymphoid, lupus nephritis, and schizophrenia) (Fig . 1F and Table S2). It is worth noting that the above diseases include two infectious diseases (gonorrhea and influenza). Although the classical strategy against infectious diseases in the past mainly targeted pathogen proteins, host molecule-targeted therapies have gradually become the focus of antiinfectious drug development due to their low drug resistance and broad spectrum . Therefore, the ESKG-predicted causative genes related to infectious diseases may be potential targets of antiinfective drugs . We found that several ESKG-predicted causative genes, which received high gene-disease association scores in DisGeNET, were confirmed by previous studies but were overlooked in the initial KG-based prediction . For example, through the ESKG and TransE model, we predicted that CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) may act as a causative gene of lymphocytic leukemia . CEBPA is a transcription factor that plays a role in cell cycle regulation and granulocyte differentiation . A study has shown that the gene mutation and abnormal regulation of CEBPA at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels can induce acute myeloid leukemia, which is an important branch of lymphocytic leukemia . In addition, we predicted that caspase-3 (CASP3) is a causative gene of AD . Previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of proteins in the caspase family is associated with AD-related neurodegeneration . CASP3, an important member of the caspase family, has been shown to be a major effector in the apoptotic cascade leading to neuronal apoptosis . Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), also known as autoimmune diabetes, is a chronic disease characterized by the loss of pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin deficiency, which leads to hyperglycemia . Using the ESKG and the TransE model, we predicted that uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) could be a causative gene of T1DM . UCP2 is a transporter of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is considered to be a key regulator of energy and glucose homeostasis . It has been reported that UCP2 is negative for the regulation of insulin secretion, and its gene polymorphism is also associated with diabetes mellitus and other chronic complications of diabetes . There is increasing evidence that drugs can treat diabetes by down-regulating the expression of UCP2.\"}},\n",

       "   'text': 'Results . Construction and validation of ESKG . In this study, we constructed an evolutionary knowledge-containing KG called ESKG (Fig . 1A). The ESKG not only contained various types of common biological data (such as gene-disease associations, gene-gene interactions, biological processes, subcellular localization of proteins, drug-target associations, and drug-disease associations) but also integrated the evolutionary data (Ohnologs and evolutionary stages) of genes (Fig . 1A). The constructed ESKG involved more than 4 million triplets and 16 kinds of relations, such as disease-disease associations, gene-gene associations, gene-disease associations, and disease-disease associations (Table S1). Then, we utilized a classical KG embedding model named TransE to learn low-dimensional vector representations (i.e . embeddings) of entities and relations in the ESKG . The embedding representations of the entities and relations learned by the TransE model were visualized by the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm in our study . The t-SNE reduces high-dimensional vectors to graphical representations in a 2D space, and nearby points have similar embedding representations . Figure 1B-E shows that the embedding representations of the same type of entities or relations in the ESKG have relatively good colocalization in a 2D space, which reflects the effectiveness of the ESKG to a certain extent . To further validate the biological significance of the ESKG, we applied the ESKG to the identification of causative genes for 19 kinds of complex diseases based on TransE (see Materials and methods). Causative genes were collected from DisGeNET (https: //www.disgenet.org/). DisGeNET has developed a reliable scoring system for gene-disease associations with scores that range from 0 to 1, where higher scores represent higher confidence in gene-disease associations . The reliable scoring system of DisGeNET has been supported by extensive literature evidence with high confidence . In order to ensure the strong correlation and reliability of gene-disease associations, we selected the genes with the highest 10% of DisGeNET scores for each disease as causative genes for the corresponding disease, covering 72,266 gene-disease associations . Of these causative gene-disease associations, 10.41% (7,520 of 72,266) were existing successful targets in SCG-Drug database . This ratio was significantly higher than that of noncausative gene-disease associations included in the DisGeNET (4.26%, 30,942/725,588) (P = 0, hypergeometric distribution test). These results indicated that the prediction of causative genes can facilitate the identification of successful drug targets . In this paper, to demonstrate the efficacy of the ESKG, we filtered out the existing triplets of DisGeNET-derived causative genes and the corresponding diseases in the initial KG and ESKG for each disease.'}},\n",

Lastly, the 'reference' key provides a hyperlink to the data source (s) from which the record was curated . Technical Validation . Systematic validation of DrugMechDB associations . Validating the reliability of a knowledge graph is a crucial step that ensures the correctness of the captured information . In this work, we assessed the accuracy of captured DrugMechDB associations by comparing them to existing data sources . For this, we leverage an external biomedical knowledge graph: Mechanistic Repositioning Network (MechRepoNet). Briefly, MechRepoNet is a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph that was constructed by integrating 18 different data sources and using Biolink Model for standardization . Given that MechRepoNet encompasses a wider network that spans various domains, we employed it as an external benchmark for verifying the plausibility of the associations recorded in DrugMechDB . Evaluating association types between concept types (ignoring edge predicates), we found that 2,924 (28.71%) of the 10,184 unique associations captured in DrugMechDB are also contained within MechRepoNet . To demonstrate that DrugMechDB associations are broadly consistent with the knowledge captured in MechRepoNet, we conducted a bootstrapping analysis . For each DrugMechDB association type, nonparametric bootstrapping was applied to sample simulated association types (with replacement) to calculate the percentage of matching with MechRepoNet . This procedure was repeated 1,000 times to construct a percentage distribution from which the mean and 99% CI were calculated . The p-value was calculated as the fraction of the distribution in which the simulated percentage of matching was greater than or equal to the observed percentage . Results in Table 2 show that the average p-value of the ten most frequent association types is less than 0.001, demonstrating that observed overlapping between DrugMechDB and the broader knowledge captured by MechRepoNet is unlikely to occur by chance . The association type 'BiologicalProcess'-'BiologicalProcess' has the least overlap among the most frequent DrugMechDB association types, highlighting that MechRepoNet does not cover all curated association types of DrugMechDB . To incorporate the missing information in MechRepoNet, we propose using DrugMechDB as a roadmap, helping to prioritize the most significant relationships involved in drug mechanisms and facilitating the integration of biomedical sources.\"}},\n",

Here, we provide a detailed explanation of the data resources utilized and the curation process undertaken to build DrugMechDB . Data sources . DrugMechDB was constructed considering drug-disease indications from the DrugCentral database, using the version downloaded on September 18, 2020 . The main source for curation arises from either the Mechanism of Action section from DrugBank, or the Description section within Inxight Drugs . Other resources included review articles, GeneOntology, UniProt, Reactome, and well-sources Wikipedia articles, which references were authenticated by curators . Primary literature sources containing experimental results were excluded, ensuring that only highly curated and high-confidence information was included . Data model . DrugMechDB provides researchers with a consistent and structured information source on drug mechanisms . To achieve this, we adopted the Biolink Model (version 1.3.0). The Biolink Model is a standardized hierarchy of biomedical entity classes that serves as a universal framework for biomedical data representation and linkage . It encompasses a wide range of entity types such as genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, and biological processes, and defines the predicates that describe the relationships between these entity types . The standardization of data in DrugMechDB to the Biolink Model enables the mapping of concepts and relationships to a common vocabulary, thus allowing interoperability between various data sources . Therefore, researchers can easily combine data from DrugMechDB with other biomedical data sources that also employ the same data model, enabling researchers to perform comprehensive analyses and gain new insights into drug mechanisms of action .

While free-text descriptions offer a comprehensive narrative of a drug's mechanism, they can sometimes include information that is not directly relevant to the mechanism of action . Consequently, the process of defining the most suitable relationships that describe a drug's action can be subjective, resulting in inconsistent annotations . To ensure consistency, accuracy, and clarity among path representations of DrugMechDB records, we established a formal curation guide . Briefly, we ensured to maintain the order of interactions to reflect cause and effect between two concepts, representing the sequence of events or influences . To streamline the paths and eliminate unnecessary complexity, we removed any information that did not significantly contribute to the overall understanding of the drug's action . Additionally, when multiple related concepts were involved in a sequence of interactions, we summarized them into a single all-encompassing concept, allowing for a more concise and cohesive representation of the drug's mechanism, reducing redundancy, and improving the clarity of the path.\"}},\n",
