KGE maps entities and relations into a low-dimensional vector space, using simple mathematical calculations instead of explicitly defining the reasoning process, improving computational efficiency vastly . KGE model defines a scoring function to measure the probability of the existence of a triplet . To improve the reasoning effectiveness, some models aim to strengthen the expressive ability of the scoring function, and some multimodal models add additional information, such as categories and descriptions .

The concept of knowledge graph (KG) was formally proposed by Google in 2012, and its initial roles were to optimize search results, enhance search quality, and improve Google user experiences . The KG is a multirelational graph composed of entities (nodes) and relations (different types of edges).

SDKG-11 is obtained through original triplet extraction, standard entity set construction, entity linking and relation linking . We implement multimodal reasoning by reverse-hyperplane projection for SDKGs based on structure, category and description embeddings . Multimodal reasoning improves pre-existing models on all SDKGs using entity prediction task as the evaluation protocol .

Considering the event that it is hard to access all the knowledge from literature (e.g . all PubMed abstracts), limiting to several diseases allows for a greater concentration of valid information . We consider 11 diseases in this work, named SDKG-11, including 5 cancers (colon cancer, gallbladder cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer) and 6 non-cancer diseases (Alzheimer's disease, COPD, coronary heart disease, diabetes, heart failure and rheumatoid arthritis).</context><pmid>35150235</pmid>\n",
      "<context>On that basis, it is urgently necessary to extract information and build a plague knowledge graph and knowledge base.</context><pmid>36412326</pmid>\n",
      "<context>We constructed the PPKG by combining manual relational curation and automatic concept annotation . Specifically, we manually extracted detailed annotations from 134 articles for the ppstatement knowledge base (see \"Manual curation of the ppstatement knowledge base\" section) and automatically annotated broadly covered concepts by using a concept identifier for the ppconcept knowledge base (see \"Automatic generation of the ppconcept knowledge base\" section). Both knowledge bases are stored in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple format . We imported them into an RDF triple store (i.e . GraphDB database) along with the MeSH (version 2020), UMLS (version 2020AA Full Release) and SNOMED CT (version 20180802) databases . We chose the open-source GraphDB database platform as our current store because of its high performance and industry acceptance . GraphDB provides the core infrastructure for data integration, relational exploration, and graph visualization . In addition, it allows users to calculate the data expansion ratio, which is the ratio of the inferred triples to the explicit triples under RDFS reasoning.</context><pmid>36347868</pmid>\n",
      "<context>Data lead to information, and information leads to knowledge . Vast amounts of data are being produced at a breathtaking pace, and this explosion in the amount of generated data is causing the number and size of databases and repositories to increase exponentially . In the biomedical domain, this big data problem gets further compounded by the resulting compartmentalization of data resources according to specialty, likely driven by the enormous biological complexity underlying human physiology (Fig . 1). Even where data and factual knowledge are stored in public repositories, their access and interpretation are still limited by physical, technical and thematic compartmentalization, making it difficult if not impossible for medical professionals to utilize this body of information and connect the dots to facilitate the emergence of knowledge . Given the complexity of existing relationships among different biomedical fields, graph databases have recently gained popularity as a practical solution to integrate such disparate sources of information . Knowledge graphs with biomedical content have been developed using a variety of strategies, content and target applications.</context><pmid>36759942</pmid>\n",
      "<context>Knowledge graphs (KGs) are quickly becoming a common-place tool for storing relationships between entities from which higher-level reasoning can be conducted . KGs are typically stored in a graph-database format, and graph-database queries can be used to answer questions of interest that have been posed by users such as biomedical researchers . For simple queries, the inclusion of direct connections in the KG and the storage and analysis of query results are straightforward; however, for complex queries, these capabilities become exponentially more challenging with each increase in complexity of the query . For instance, one relatively complex query can yield a KG with hundreds of thousands of query results . Thus, the ability to efficiently query, store, rank and explore sub-graphs of a complex KG represents a major challenge to any effort designed to exploit the use of KGs for applications in biomedical research and other domains . We present Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways as an abstraction layer and user interface to more easily query KGs and store, rank and explore query results.</context><pmid>31410449</pmid>\n",
      "<context>For completely understanding the role of gut microbiota and neurotransmitters in mental disorders with a knowledge graph, like MiKG4MD, more entities and relations should be included in its knowledge base . Besides this, in the current study, we extracted entities and relations manually to ensures accuracy of the data . Manual processing, however, face huge challenges when dealing with large and wide datasets . We expect the knowledge graph would not have to be updated manually to have new information placed within it . Let the knowledge graph update itself when it collects information about entities, their properties and attributes, and relationships involving them . To realize the automation of knowledge extraction and regular updating of the database, other advanced technology (including deep learning, neuroevolution, and evolutionary algorithms, will be employed in our future works . Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</context><pmid>33262885</pmid>\n",
      "<context>Knowledge systems have also differed in terms of the ingestion method used in their construction; many systems utilized an extract-transform-load (ETL) approach, whereas others used API endpoints to query upstream knowledge sources; one blended both ETL and API approaches for knowledge graph construction . For automation, previous efforts have used general-purpose scripting languages, batch frameworks, rule-based build frameworks, semantic web-compliant build frameworks such as PheKnowLator, and parallel-capable systems such as Snakemake . While previous efforts have resulted in biomedical knowledge graphs incorporating (individually) UMLS, SemMedDB, multiple major drug knowledge bases (such as ChEMBL and DrugBank), a standards-compliant semantic layer, and a parallel build system, so far as we are aware, none have incorporated all of these features in a single system providing both canonicalized and pre-canonicalized knowledege graphs . We have developed RTX-KG2, an open-source biomedical knowledge graph representing biomedical concepts and their relationships.</context><pmid>36175836</pmid>\n",
      "<context>A proliferation of data sources has led to the notional existence of an implicit Knowledge Graph (KG) that contains vast amounts of biological knowledge contributed by distributed Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, challenges arise when integrating data across multiple APIs due to incompatible semantic types, identifier schemes, and data formats . We present ROBOKOP KG (http: //robokopkg.renci.org), which is a KG that was initially built to support the open biomedical question-answering application, ROBOKOP (Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge-Oriented Pathways) (http: //robokop.renci.org). Additionally, we present the ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph Builder (KGB), which constructs the KG and provides an extensible framework to handle graph query over and integration of federated data sources.</context><pmid>31769676</pmid>\n",
      "<context>Knowledge Graph (KG) is becoming increasingly important in the biomedical field . Deriving new and reliable knowledge from existing knowledge by KG embedding technology is a cutting-edge method . Some add a variety of additional information to aid reasoning, namely multimodal reasoning . However, few works based on the existing biomedical KGs are focused on specific diseases . This work develops a construction and multimodal reasoning process of Specific Disease Knowledge Graphs (SDKGs). We construct SDKG-11, a SDKG set including five cancers, six non-cancer diseases, a combined Cancer5 and a combined Diseases11, aiming to discover new reliable knowledge and provide universal pre-trained knowledge for that specific disease field . SDKG-11 is obtained through original triplet extraction, standard entity set construction, entity linking and relation linking . We implement multimodal reasoning by reverse-hyperplane projection for SDKGs based on structure, category and description embeddings . Multimodal reasoning improves pre-existing models on all SDKGs using entity prediction task as the evaluation protocol . We verify the model's reliability in discovering new knowledge by manually proofreading predicted drug-gene, gene-disease and disease-drug pairs.</context><pmid>35150235</pmid>\n",
      "<context>Second, we have published this structured review article to the community in the form of a centralized resource (accessible at http: //ngly1graph.org/contribute/), a living knowledge graph that can be continually refined by community curation . To put in context our new way of processing scientific knowledge for comparison, typically structured knowledge resources are created by curation efforts . On the one hand, there are homogeneous edge-specific resources such as GO, BioGRID, STRING, HPRD, UniProt, Reactome, KEGG or MP . On the other hand, there are heterogeneous data integration knowledge bases such as the Monarch knowledge graph . Curated resources are vast but incomplete because the majority of the wealth of knowledge is unstructured since expert curation cannot keep the pace of scientific production . To organize this knowledge, several text mined heterogeneous knowledge bases have been developed . Text mined resources are comprehensive but without the semantic specificity required to be useful for the rare disease field.</context><pmid>32283553</pmid>\n",
      "<context>While these meta-databases are valuable, their objective is typically different from the goals of a domain-specific review article, which usually focuses on a richly heterogeneous network of knowledge in a relatively limited scope of biology . Knowledge graphs are computer-readable semantic representations of relational information, where concepts are encoded as nodes, and the relationships between those concepts are represented as edges . Knowledge graphs make it easy to integrate information from many sources, to explore heterogeneous information within a single data model and to infer new relationships via efficient queries . Knowledge graphs have been used to organize background knowledge for data interpretation and hypothesis generation in a wide variety of contexts . This work focuses on the complementary challenge of organizing a diverse and heterogeneous graph of knowledge relevant to a research question in a relatively defined domain area for hypothesis generation, and performing this integration in a way that is amenable to computational analysis . We call this type of effort a 'structured review article' . We propose structured review articles as knowledge graphs focused on specific domains and research questions.</context><pmid>32283553</pmid>\n",
      "<context>The final knowledge graph contained 9361 nodes, including 6152 genes or proteins, 2486 diseases or phenotypes, 355 pathways, 193 genotypes, 117 tissues, 50 variants, 7 chemical compounds and 1 organism and contained 234 717 edges across 29 relationship types . Our final NGLY1-focused knowledge graph integrated data and knowledge derived from scientific literature, domain experts, databases and gene expression data . The amount of effort required to develop the structured review depended on the structure of the resource added, being the curation process of the scientific literature the most demanding . Conceptually, the creation of structured review articles is as subjective as a regular review . The objective part is that researchers should focus on collecting relevant information, background knowledge and experimental data that are key to the hypothesis and research question . Hence, the construction workflow of a review article is generalizable to (i) collect, (ii) integrate as a knowledge graph, (iii) import into a graph database and (iv) query the review for hypothesis generation.</context><pmid>32283553</pmid>\n",
      "<context>The main issue of of term co-occurrence approach is that the extracted relationships lack logical explanations . NLP-based methods strongly depends on the availability of domain-specific NLP tools . Graph-based methods don't consider the different semantic types of nodes in the graph . Most importantly, all existing methods have not exploited all available published biomedical literature for drug discovery . They only focus on part of the abstracts related to disease of interest . This could lead to missing the valuable informations existing in the filtered literature . In this paper, we propose a biomedical knowledge graph based inference method to discover drug therapies from literature . Knowledge graphs (KGs) are collections of relational facts, which have proven to be sources of valuable information that have become important for various applications . The famous knowledge graphs include Freebase, DBpedia, Nell and YAGO, etc . Here, we first construct a biomedical knowledge graph called SemKG with relations extracted from PubMed abstracts.</context><pmid>29843590</pmid>\n",
      "<context>In addition, the federation of structured data from various sources to create an exploitable centralized knowledge base could empower large-scale-assisted reasoning, and thus constitute an interesting step toward closing the gap in metabolomics . Networks have been proven useful in various domains for storing information and modeling knowledge . The resulting Knowledge Graphs (KG) are especially suited for information retrieval tasks that require bridging information through indirect relationships in complex networks . A KG is a formal and structured representation of knowledge as a graph of entities and relations, commonly described in a triple formalism (Subject-Predicate-Object). In a KG, each entity, property or relation can also be described by a semantic layer, precisely defining the related concepts using structured and standardized vocabularies, usually from the appropriate ontologies . The last decade has seen the rise of available representation of knowledge in such formalism, highlighting the potential of Semantic Web technology to aggregate and exploit these datasets.</context><pmid>34478489</pmid>\n",
      "<context>In this paper, we introduce this rare diseases integrative knowledge graph, built in Neo4j as a backend graph database ingesting a large variety of biomedical datasets . We detail data preparation and entity resolution methodologies in generating initial insights and results, and the potential benefits for utilizing a knowledge graph-based approach to interpret biomedical research at a scale and pace that would be unsustainable when limited to the manual curation efforts that define current processes used in curating consumer health information.</context><pmid>33183351</pmid>\n",
      "<context>The graph can be used to facilitate our understanding of this complex disease, for example, by exploring precursor symptoms and sequelae of stroke, therapeutic drugs, and the pathway for treating related diseases . In the field of biomedicine, knowledge bases (KBs) such as Gene ontology, disease ontology, reference terms for national drug archives, and basic models of anatomy have been prominent examples of efforts to provide structured knowledge systematically . Some of these KBs, e.g . OpenKG, BenevolentAI, and KnowLife have made significant contributions to the development of the biomedical field, including recent drug repositioning for COVID-19, SemaTyP, and protein-drug target KG have been used . Despite many efforts to provide more structured data, vast amounts of relevant knowledge are still hidden in the biomedical literature . There are three main limitations to previous work on KB construction . First, most biomedical KBs are manually constructed and curated, which defer them from keeping up with the pace of novel discoveries.</context><pmid>34325669</pmid>\n",
      "<context>Naturally, such knowledge graphs have been difficult to create, as they require deep expertise in a variety of domains . In particular, biomedicine has been slow to adopt this potentially transformative approach, in part due to the complexity of the underlying information . While some focus on experimentally determined information, others include primary data, literature mining and predicted relationships . In addition, these resources can be implemented as property graphs or using RDF (triples) representation (DataCommons https: //www.datacommons.org/), which largely determines the range of applications they can be used for . Finally, some biomedical graphs are built using semi-automated methods, and others like SPOKE, Robokop and the comparative toxicogenomics database, CTD, require extensive manual curation (Table 2 illustrates key features of some of the most relevant biomedical graphs available).</context><pmid>36759942</pmid>\n",
      "<context>We also extracted the virus taxonomy tree from NCBI to build the corresponding KG . Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny KG was constructed by referencing Nextstrain metadata . We mainly leveraged semistructured data for building the KGs of concept, encyclopedia, health, prevention, goods, and character . Taking the encyclopedia KG as an example, its knowledge in the form of RDF triples is extracted from the integration of several encyclopedia sites (eg, Baidu Baike, Hudong Baike, Chinese Wikipedia). We particularly considered the following four types of semistructured data for knowledge extraction: internal links, infoboxes, categories, and classification trees . For an infobox, the page title is treated as a subject, each attribute of the infobox is treated as a predicate, and the corresponding attribute value is treated as the object.</context><pmid>35476822</pmid>\n",
      "<context>We also observe that description annotation is better than category annotation, since the former has much more information . Moreover, when there is already description annotation (S + D), adding category annotation (S + C+D) will not improve much . Suppose, we intend to consider more modal annotations, image annotation (e.g . structure schematics of proteins and drugs) is the most likely annotation to be added . In addition, the annotation of relation and multi-omics are also potentially promising directions . From the perspective of knowledge relevance, triplets from the literature of each specific disease are more focused . However, considering the completeness of information from the perspective of 'big data', we highly recommend combining all available information into one corpus, since some inferred knowledge from one SDKG may already exist in another SDKG . Next, we will try to extract knowledge from more general themes, such as 'cancer' or 'disease' to construct the initial KG.</context><pmid>35150235</pmid>\n",
